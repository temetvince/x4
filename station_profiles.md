# Station Profiles

## Using Station Profiles in X4: Foundations

In X4, you can manually set buy and sell prices for a station's resources, intermediates, products, and trade wares by utilizing the buy and sell percentages associated with a "station profile". This method allows you to coalesce percentage based ware pricing into defined profiles which perform certain roles.

1. **Select the Station Profile**: Choose the appropriate station profile for your station (e.g., Factory, Depot, etc.) based on its role and priorities.

1. **Determine the Buy/Sell Percentage**: Refer to the profile's buy or sell percentage (e.g., Factory buys at 90% and sells at 20%).

1. **Lookup the Price from the Table**: Using the ware table, find the price for the ware that corresponds to the selected percentage (e.g., for Advanced Composites at 90%, the price is 626 cr).

1. **Enter in Game**: In the station's trade settings, manually input the calculated buy and sell prices for each ware category (resources, intermediates, products, trade wares), and ensure you also set either restricted (your own faction) or unrestricted (all factions) trading as per the station profile.

### Station Profile Guidelines

When setting up your stations with profiles, follow these guidelines to ensure optimal performance and trade efficiency:

_Note: Each sector of distance from another station counts as one star of Management skill. If a station is N sectors away you need at least N Management stars to manage it effectively. The maximum manageable distance without support is 5 sectors. Beyond 5 sectors you must extend range with Extenders (some limitations apply) or use ships with the Fill Shortages behavior._

1. Build your production cores

   - Place Factories (producers) in sectors suited to the production chain.

2. Add Warehouses to distribute goods

   - Place Warehouses within 5 sectors of the Factories they serve.
   - Assign subordinate traders to Warehouses.
   - Do not place a Warehouse within 5 sectors of another Warehouse to avoid competition between your own stations.

3. Place Depots for mining/refining

   - Build Depots within 5 sectors of good mining sectors and within 5 sectors of the Warehouses they feed.
   - Assign subordinate miners to Depots (do not assign subordinate traders that are miners).
   - Depots can be upgraded to Refineries by adding Tier 1 production modules â you do not need to switch the station profile to Factory.

4. Create Exports stations for selling to other factions

   - Place Exports within 5 sectors of Warehouses.
   - Assign subordinate traders to Exports.

5. Use Extenders to widen trade range

   - Build Extenders where you need to extend trading range.
   - Assign subordinate traders to Extenders.
   - Limitations: Extenders do not sell back to Warehouses. They sell only to Building Storages, Factories, Docks, Fill profiles (and to Trading stations as described in the Trading profile).

6. Place Docks for end-user needs

   - Build Docks (Equipment Docks, Wharves, Shipyards) within 5 sectors of Warehouses or within 5 sectors of Extenders.

7. Deploy Trading Stations in other empires

   - Place Trading Stations in other empiresâ sectors to move wares across the universe.
   - Assign subordinate traders to Trading Stations.
   - To avoid internal trading with your own stations:
     - Keep the Trading Station at least 6 sectors away from any of your stations that have assigned traders, or
     - Use Activity Blacklists to prevent internal trade. When using Blacklists:
       - Ensure your own stations that have traders exclude the Trading Stationâs sector.
       - Ensure the Trading Station excludes any sector within 5 sectors of the Trading Station that contains a station you own with assigned traders.

8. Use Fill and Empty profiles where appropriate
   - Use the Fill profile on stations you want to prioritize filling â Fill stations buy but do not sell.
   - Use the Empty profile on stations you want to prioritize emptying â Empty stations sell but do not buy.
