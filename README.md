## Weapons Characteristics (Unmodified)
### Missiles
* Tracking
    * EMP - like a teleporting bomb, drops ships out of travel drive, disables boost
    * Smart - ignores flares
* Dumbfire
    * Dumbfire - when you want speed
    * Heavy Cluster - when you want power, about 60% the damage of a heavy torpedo, but MUCH cheaper. This is important for carrier cargo space reasons - you can fit more damage per cargo space if you're resupplying heavy cluster missiles than if you're resupplying torpedoes
* Torpedo
    * Torpedo - Excellent vs capitals/stations
    * Great on Boron Threshers due to cargo capacity

### Turrets
* Argon
    * Argon Flak - only worthwhile turret outside of Arc, Argon because of best tracking rate
* Boron
    * Arc - slows down ships of the same class or lower
    * Ion Pulse Turrets - slow turning but extremely accurate, deadly and long-ranged. I don't like these on M ships due to the unstable platform they provide, but probably the best M turret in the game for L ships.
    * Phase turrets - like phase guns/phase cannons, no exciting effects but still your best option if you need hull damage out of a Boron turret.

### Hardpoints
* Generic
    * Commonwealth Pulse - generic anti fighter gun. Does the job but lacks DPS - beams are better vs fighters, bolts or shotguns are better vs M and bigger.
    * Beam - ultimate anti small gun, great for drones and particularly fast fighters where even pulse struggles to hit.
    * Bolt - all-rounder. Struggles to hit fighters but punches harder vs bigger.
    * Shotguns - Lots of overlap with bolt. Even better vs M/L, high velocity means surprisingly good vs S.
    * Proton Barrage - Bolt but better in every meaningful way.
    * Plasma - best burst and sustain DPS for L/XL killing, completely useless vs S.
    * Paranid Blast Mortar (S) - Plasma+ -> more DPS, better heat management, better velocity
    * Split Thermal Disintegrators - weird mix of bolt and pulse. Low velocity/high fire ok vs fighters, shield bleed effect kills capital shields while the shields are still up. Like Burst Rays but capable of dealing actual damage once surface modules are dealt with.
    * Snipers - 10km range (realistically vs capitals only at range), wait 30 seconds between shots. Awful heat management, mediocre damage output. No hardpoint gimbal. Feel awful to use. Can sometime shit M ships, but by the time you're ready to fire again they'll have recharged half the damage you did
* Terran
    * Proton Barrage - faster than bolt, higher heat/slower than TER pulse 
    * TER Pulse - commonwealth pulse but better against fighters. Still struggles vs heavier stuff.
* Boron
    * Ion Atomiser (M) - Disrupts the maneuvering thrusters of S and M ships, reducing their turn rate.
    * Ion Pulse Railgun (M) - Very accurate, effective against both hull and shields, but heat caps quite quickly in sustained fighting.
    * Arc Gun (S) - Small equivalent of Ion Pulse Railgun
    * Ion Gatling (S) - The Ion Gatling disrupts the engines of S and M ships, reducing their speed.
    * Phase Cannon/Gun - not exciting but vital in an effective Boron loadout, the only efficient way to deal hull damage. Deadly accurate like most Boron weapons but no special effects.
